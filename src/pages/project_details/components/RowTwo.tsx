Without reader-driven insights, owners rely on intuition rather than data â€” leading to shelf space inefficiency and outdated inventory selections. Readers log and rate the books theyâ€™ve read. Each book is tagged by genre and content. The system analyzes these patterns â€” identifying frequently enjoyed genres and recurring titles â€” to generate data-driven recommendations. These insights are then shared with library owners, helping them prioritize which books and genres to stock, ensuring shelves reflect real reader interests."
